              The love for nature grew through his South African schooling
              career as he became particularly interested in Mathematics and the
              Natural Sciences. As his appreciation for the fundamental
              principles that governed existence grew, Bonga chose to pursue the
              sciences. He was particular fascinated by Physics and Mathematics
              and how these subjects had the ability to give a full description
              of any system in nature. Books such as Jeffery Weeks’

            <span class="about-page-text11">
              inspired Bonga to get a deeper understanding of the fabric of
              existence. In fact, while he was studying, Bonga began to work at
              a book shop in a local mall, where he could have access to new
              scientific writings that would expand his horizon. There he came
              across books such as

                by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths that related some
                mathematical and computational models to everyday situations.
                Bonga would complete his undergraduate degree in Applied
                Mathematics and Physics at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, in
                2019. It was during this journey that Bonga discovered that
                innovation in the future would require a strong grasp of the
                philosophy of nature. Bonga would to graduate as the top third
                year student in the Physics.

                To enhance his innovation skills in a manner that would allow
                him to be close to science and mathematics and still help the
                community, he decided to strengthen his scientific and
                technological comprehension through studying Electrical and
                Computer Engineering at the University of Cape Town. Although
                clear to him that the knowledge that he had gained from his
                previous undergraduate degree would enhance his understanding,
                the extent to which his knowledge could be extended and applied
                was something that he could not forsee. He also realised that he
                had a long way to go to combine his passion for mathematics,
                physics and humanity with topics relating to other fields such
                as computer science and medical technology.

                In the time since he registered for his engineering degree, in
                2020, Bonga has worked hard to acquire skills that could help
                him achieve his goal to innovate through mathematics and physics
                in an impactful way. He learned coding languages such as Python,
                Java, and C/C++ but most importantly, learned how to learn
                quickly. He would also gain exceptional knowledge over signals
                and the electrical devices that generated them, modulated and
                sampled them. More and more, he realised to how data was capture
                from nature, interpreted through computers, and used to change
                the world.

                Today, Bonga is continuing his ‘postgrad undergraduate’ degree
                in Electrical and Computer Engineering. He believes that the
                next step for him is to get his hands dirty with a challenge in
                software engineering jobs, data center management jobs in
                medical technology or agricultural technology that directly
                applies the concepts that he has acquire through his educaiton.
                He is a contributing member of the Engineers Without Borders
                Society at the University of Cape Town where he is working on a
                project for feeding underserved students by creating a
                tech-garden that can monitor and control the state of the
                environment electronically. He is also working with a team of
                medical students on health related mobile applications for
                monitoring and managing certain illness.

                The Philosophy of Nature, or science as it is known today, has
                principles rooted in the understanding of the elegance and
                intricacies of matter, space and time. With a Bachelor of
                Science in Applied Mathematics and Physics and pursuing a
                Bachelor of Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering,
                Bonga describes himself as a 'philosopher of nature'. It is
                through this understanding that, Bonga, seeks to enhance
                humanity's integration in nature through applied the sciences.

                Bonga Njamela grew up in the verdant green province of
                Mpumalanga, in South Africa. He credits his love and curiosity
                for nature to his grandfather who had instilled in his family
                the obligation to be rooted to reality through the appreciation
                of nature and the world around us. On his visits to his
                grandfather's farm, Bonga recalls adventures with his
                grandfather, family and friends to the Kruger National Park and
                other spectacular natural scenary around the province. His
                grandfather and grandmother were also very crafty - with his
                grandfather carving exceptionally beautiful wooden kitchen
                utensils, axes, spears and other tools which would be used
                around his farm. Bonga would observe this and later grow a
                tremendous appreciation for mastering skills through
                deliberation and practice.
